Richard Mann – CV Coursework
The core function files for this coursework are the following Matlab files:
1. detectnum.m
2. RecogniseFace.m
Details of the inputs to and outputs from these functions are provided in the project report, sections 2.9 and 3.5.
Additional files are provided together with these core functions.  The additional Matlab files operate as test harnesses for the core functions together with the sample image files also provided.  These therefore serve to illustrate some of the other scripts developed.
